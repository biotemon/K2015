1. **SupplementaryData1.xlsx** Differential expression analysis and annotation of predicted gene sequences in the Kleindienst _et al._ metatranscriptome. The extended version of this file includes more details about annotation features and regularized log-normalized of mapped counts per experimental observation. 
2. **SupplementaryData2.xlsx** Representative sequences to build a guiding phylogenetic tree for phylobetadiversity analysis of the metatranscriptomic dataset.
3. **SuppCode_p1.pdf** This includes all scripts used for the AEM paper, except the code run in R.
4. **SuppCode_p1.py** Same as SuppCode_p1.pdf but in executable python script.
5. **SuppCode_p2_Rsection.pdf** This includes all scripts used for the AEM paper that were run in R.
6. **SuppCode_p2_Rsection.r** Same as SuppCode_p2_Rsection.pdf but in executable R script.
